ocaml-geoip
================

OCaml bindings to libgeoip <http://maxmind.com> library.

Build
-----

Bindings code is generated by camlidl and the
generated code is included in source tree. But that
code still references camlidl header files, so camlidl
is a build dependency.

Install camlidl and run make.
